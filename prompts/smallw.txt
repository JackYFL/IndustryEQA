**Role:** Act as an expert safety analyst for industrial warehouse environments.

**Input:** A video recording from a warehouse setting.

**Task:** Analyze the video and generate a comprehensive set of relevant Question-Answer (QA) pairs based *only* on the video content. 
For each QA pair, generate multiple type-question-answer pairs. For answer, generate direct answer and reasoning answer.

**Core Focus & QA Categories:**
Your primary goal is generating diverse QA pairs with a **strong emphasis on safety (at least 50% of total QAs)**. 
Cover the following categories, ensuring a mix of simple factual questions and complex reasoning questions:

1. Safety-Focused Question
* Human Safety: Evaluating direct risks to human safety, such as potential collisions, falling hazards, ergonomic issues, proper usage of personal protective equipment, and hazardous zones.
* Equipment Safety: Recognizing risks associated with warehouse equipment, including pathway obstructions, improper stacking, equipment placement, spills, obstacles, inadequate lighting, and fire hazards.
2. General Scene Understanding
* Spatial Understanding: Questions related to object positions, distances, directions, and spatial relationships.
* Temporal Understanding: Understanding the sequence and order of events, including counting objects or occurrences over time in videos.
* Object Recognition: Identifying and classifying objects present in the scenes.
* Attribute Recognition: Identifying object attributes such as color, size, shape, state, and condition.
* Causal Reasoning: Determining cause-effect relationships through clear, verifiable yes-or-no questions.
* Commonsense Reasoning: Applying general warehouse and industrial safety knowledge to interpret scene details.

**QA Requirements:**
1. Generate 25 high-quality, distinct QA pairs.
2. Prioritize questions with factual, objective answers based on visual observation.
3. Focus on one specific element or condition per question; allow 10% multiple-choice format when suitable.
4. Ensure questions align with their assigned type.
5. Vary difficulty from simple to complex, strictly based on the video.
6. Questions and answers should be concise.
7. For each question, "direct answer" should be unique rather than multiple ambiguous answers, and "reasoning answer" should not exceed one sentence.
8. Do not reference specific times or frames.
9. Ensure clarity and unambiguity in all questions.
10. Although each type of question have a reasoning_answer, you still need to explicitly generate some difficult Causal Reasoning and Commonsense Reasoning type questions.

**Output Format:**
Provide your answers in strictly valid JSON format.

**Examples:**

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "type": "Attribute Recognition",
        "question": "What colors are the interlocking, stackable items placed on the floor in aisle 02? Choose the answer from the following options: Yellow, Blue, Green.",
        "direct_answer": "Yellow.",
        "reasoning_answer": "interlocking, stackable items are placed near workers, which can be seen that they are yellow."
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "type": "Object Recognition",
        "question": "What piece of equipment is used by a worker to move multiple boxes stacked vertically?",
        "direct_answer": "Hand truck.",
        "reasoning_answer": "A worker is seen using a hand truck to transport boxes."
    },
]
```

Now analyze the video and generate the QA pairs:
