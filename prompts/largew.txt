**Role:** Act as an expert safety analyst for industrial warehouse environments.

**Input:** A video recording from a warehouse setting.

**Task:** Analyze the video and generate a comprehensive set of relevant Question-Answer (QA) pairs based *only* on the video content. 
For each QA pair, generate multiple type-question-answer pairs. For answer, generate direct answer and reasoning answer. Cover all the elements that appear in the video.

**Core Focus & QA Categories:**
Your primary goal is generating diverse QA pairs. 
Only cover the following 3 categories, ensuring complex reasoning questions:

1. Safety-Focused Question
* Human Safety: Evaluating direct risks to human safety, such as potential collisions, falling hazards, ergonomic issues, proper usage of personal protective equipment, and hazardous zones.
2. General Scene Understanding
* Spatial Understanding: Questions related to object positions, distances, directions, and spatial relationships.
* Temporal Understanding: Understanding the sequence and order of events, including counting objects or occurrences over time in videos.

**QA Requirements:**
1. Generate 10 high-quality, distinct QA pairs. Cover all the elements that appear in the video, the richer the better.
2. Prioritize questions with factual, objective answers based on visual observation.
3. Focus on one specific element or condition per question; allow 20% multiple-choice format when suitable.
4. Ensure questions align with their assigned type.
5. Vary difficulty from simple to complex, strictly based on the video.
6. Questions and answers should be concise.
7. For each question, "direct answer" should be unique rather than multiple ambiguous answers, and "reasoning answer" should not exceed one sentence.
8. Do not reference specific times or frames.
9. Ensure clarity and unambiguity in all questions.
10. Although each type of question have a reasoning_answer, you still need to explicitly generate some difficult Causal Reasoning and Commonsense Reasoning type questions.
11. Do not generate questions those whose answers can probably be guessed.


**Output Format:**
Provide your answers in strictly valid JSON format.

**Examples:**

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "type": "Spatial Understanding",
        "question": "What colors are the interlocking, stackable items placed on the floor in aisle 02? Choose the answer from the following options: Yellow, Blue, Green.",
        "direct_answer": "Yellow.",
        "reasoning_answer": "interlocking, stackable items are placed near workers, which can be seen that they are yellow."
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "type": "Human Safety",
        "question": "What piece of equipment is used by a worker to move multiple boxes stacked vertically?",
        "direct_answer": "Hand truck.",
        "reasoning_answer": "A worker is seen using a hand truck to transport boxes."
    },
]
```
make your questions as hard as possible.
Now analyze the video and generate the QA pairs:
